== Description ==

Having tested this using Firefox, Edge, Chrome on Windows 10 & Linux it works on all except for Chrome on Windows 10!
You can bypass this in Chrome by searching in the developer tools, locate the cookies, go to Tinychat.com, locate a cookie named "remember_random-number", and change the value for 'Same Site' to none and remove the tick for HttpOnly and add a tick in 'Secure',
This may only be affecting some users.

You now have to register to use the chat, you can do that at <a href="https://tinychat.com"   rel="nofollow ugc"  >Tinychat</a> , I apologise about that.

You can now access dark mode! I've added screenshots on how to turn it on, I hope it helps.

Tinychat have now removed YouTube!
Hopefully this temporary, So again I apologise about that.

This plugin is used for BuddyPress to add Tinychat video chat to Groups, so add https://tinychat.com and https://www.ruddernation.com to your whitelist,
This uses the Tinychat video chat using HTML5 WebRTC so this can be used on nearly all devices,
Once the plugin is installed, simply create a new group or choose an existing one, Selct 'manage then ' and enable, The chat allows users to display their camera/audio,
YouTube is also enabled on this, Camera/audio is 16 per room and normal chatters can be upto 100+, 
Please read the privacy policies for both companies which are available below, This plugin uses iframe to display the chat room directly from Tinychat.com,
I recommend using the Firefox browser as there is an issue with Googles Chrome browser,
This is a FREE plugin but you can upgrade to get better quality video and display a banner on your name in the chat room.

== Installation ==

* Upload the plugin to your plugins folder then activate,
* Create a new group and click enable group chat or go to an already created group and enable group chat in the admin area.

== Screenshots ==

* Select 'Manage' on your group.

* Click 'Group Chat' and then click 'Enable Group Chat' and save.

* Now click on 'Group Chat' and the chat will start to load.

* This is how the chat displays after it's loaded.

* Click the settings button.

* Toggle dark mode on and you are all set!

== Notes ==

The room name is now: http://www.domain.com/groups/*group-name*/.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Q. Can I use this if I'm not logged in?
* A. No, You have to be logged in and you have to be a member of the group.

* Q. What kind of chat is this?
* A. The chat is running in HTML5 using WebRTC, so this will work on your computer without the need for flash player anymore.
