== Description ==

This plugin is used for BuddyPress to add Tinychat video chat to Groups, so add https://tinychat.com and https://www.ruddernation.com to your whitelist,
This uses the Tinychat video chat using HTML5 WebRTC so this can be used on nearly all devices,
Once the plugin is installed, simply create a new group or choose an existing one, Selct 'manage then ' and enable, The chat allows users to display their camera/audio,
YouTube is also enabled on this, Camera/audio is 16 per room and normal chatters can be upto 100+, 
Please read the privacy policies for both companies which are available below, This plugin uses iframe to display the chat room directly from Tinychat.com,
I recommend using the Firefox browser as there is an issue with Googles Chrome browser
